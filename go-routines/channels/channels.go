// By default, sends and receives block until both the sender and receiver are ready.
// This property allows goroutines to synchronize without explicit locks or condition variables.

// In Go, channels force synchronization: a send and a receive must meet.

// When you do c <- sum (send a value into a channel):
// The sending goroutine will pause (block) until some other goroutine is ready to receive from that channel (<-c).
// Similarly, when you do x := <-c (receive a value from a channel):
// The receiving goroutine will pause (block) until some other goroutine sends a value into the channel.

// In Go, we donâ€™t usually need locks or condition variables Because of the blocking property:
// A goroutine that sends knows that the other goroutine has received when the send returns.
// A goroutine that receives knows that some goroutine has sent when the receive retur
